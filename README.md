Here are the instructions to make the file saver software work on MacOS

In repository root folder:
./scripts/rebuild.sh
 ./FileSaverTest -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile>

 Input file can be wav/flac/mp3, output file is preferably a wav file, identical to the input file
 Several chunks of the audio file should be generated as wav files (indexed by "date_idx.wav") in pending folder.
